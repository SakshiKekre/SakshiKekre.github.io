      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello hello! Thanks for visiting my website :) <br />
        I am a passionate coder, an avid learner and an enthusiastic adventurer! <br />
        Let me take you through my story briefly.

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>AI based FinTech product</h3>
        <p>
          In this tough economy, I believe no techie should have a single source of income. <br />
          We must be aware of the amazing opportunities that the financial domain has for us. <br />
          In order to equip myself with the nitty-gretties of investment and stock trading, I decided to do a project in this field. <br/>
          I am leveraging the power of AI and ML models to come up with a profitable algotithmic trading solution
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project">
        <h3>LLM based employee management portal</h3>
        <p>To learn more about Large Language models such as chatGPT, and understanding how they can be applied to some basic generative AI usecases,
            I embarked on the journey to fine tune a GPT 3.5 model (ada). <br/>
            I created a web based chat-bot-style interface to the tuned model to help employees of a dummy organization interact with it and learn more about the company's policies in a fun interactive way </p>
